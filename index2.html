      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        LPK KOMPETEN VOKASI ENERGI (LPK-KVE) was established on August 14, 2024, in Palembang in response to the increasing demand for quality training in the field of industrial engineering. 
        We aim to meet the demand for skilled workforce with technical skills in industrial engineering, particularly in sectors such as manufacturing, automotive, and technology.
      </p>
      <h3>Objectives & Goals</h3>
      <p>
        In the era of the Industrial Revolution 4.0 and Society 5.0, along with rapid technological developments, the need for skilled workforce in the field of industrial engineering is increasing. 
        Modern industries require professionals who not only understand the basic concepts of industrial engineering but also can apply their technical skills in dynamic and challenging work environments. 
        <strong>Competency Values</strong> that align with vocational education and training objectives are crucial to supporting increased productivity, efficiency, and innovation in an increasingly competitive industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recognizing this, LPK KVE aims to bridge the gap between formal education and the real demands of the labor market by providing comprehensive and relevant training programs according to the needs of DUDI (Business and Industry World). 
        Our focus includes training in welding, including SMAW, FCAW, GTAW, and GMAW processes, as well as quality fields such as Welding Inspector, Welding Supervisor, and NDT - MT/PT.
